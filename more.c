/* This file contains code which implements the "Hit <Enter> to continue"
 * message.  For the sake of uniformity, this is implemented as a special
 * key processing state, applied to a buffer which just happens to contain
 * the "Hit.." message.
 * 
 * Any single character causes this edit mode to exit, so that editing can
 * resume on the real edit buffer.
 *
 * When this key state is pushed, one character can be designated for
 * special treatment.  If that character is pressed, it will be re-inserted
 * into the type-ahead queue.  This is intended to support the use of <:>
 * to start one ex command after another.
