* Changes to hlobject
  * Changed default value to hlobject=""
  * Added support for "set" lines in elvis.syn, to allow setting of options
    in a language-dependent way.

* Changes to "fmt" program
  * It now compiles as "elvfmt"
  * It accepts -c for crown lines, and -ichars to allow chars in indentation.
    Together, these make it work well for formatting C/C++ comments.
  * The argument processing is now more POSIX-like (with ganged options).

* Changes to :help command
  * Now supports HTML help, like ":help <table".
  * Now supports display mode help, like ":help di syntax"
  * Allows trailing = in ":help set option=" lines; nice after name completion.

* Changes to folding
  * Multi-line moves across folded lines should work now.  Previously, only
    single-line motions across folds worked right.  This bug also affected
    paging -- ^B didn't work if a fold was at the top of the window.

* Miscellany
  * Tweaked calc.c to allow "make calc" to work again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2.2c, patch 1 & 2...

Bug fixes in searching:
 * incsearch didn't support ^V to quote backspace characters, etc.
 * In incsearch, /<Enter> didn't repeat the previous search.
 * The autoselect option was recently broken, but now works
 * In incsearch, some partial regular expressions caused elvis to hang.
   /\ was an example of this.
 * After exiting incsearch via <Enter> or <Esc>, the search information is
   now removed from the status line.  This should make it easier to know when
   you're in an incsearch, or in the normal command state.

Bug fixes in text objects and hlobject
 * Several text objects, including a{, caused core dumps when used on an empty
   buffer.  This occured whether the text object was part of a command, or
   merely used in the value of the hlobject option.
 * With multiple windows, highlighting in one window might get stuck (i.e.,
   it didn't follow the cursor anymore) if you briefly switched to a different
   window.
 * hlobject would sometimes cause syntax highlighting to be lost, toward the
   end of the highlighted area.
 * Not a bug, but an extension: In the value of hlobject, you can now add a
   "V" prefix to any text object to force its highlighting to affect whole
   lines.  So hlobject="a{" still causes the exact extent of the block to be
   highlighted, but hlobject="Va{" causes whole lines (including the lines
   which contain the { and } characters) to be highlighted.

Other bugs:
 * Added an error message when a script contains an unterminated {...} block.
   This is suddenly important, because users may be tempted to put a line
   such as ":set hllayers=9 hlobject=a{" in their .exrc file, but the "{"
   at the end of that line will cause elvis' ex command parser to become
   confused, and until now the user was given no clues regarding the cause.
 * The <Enter> key wasn't advancing the cursor to the next line.
 * Guide lines (via the guidewidth option) were being drawn incorrectly on
   the ~ rows after the end of the buffer.  Those rows shouldn't have guide
   lines at all.

Miscellaneous changes:
 * Added a list() function to the built-in calculator.  It converts control
   characters into printable sequences.  I needed this function to make the
   incremental search string be displayed correctly after you've typed ^V^H.
 * Added some NetBSD-specific tweaks to the "configure" script.
 * Fixed a couple of things that caused assert() statements to fail.
